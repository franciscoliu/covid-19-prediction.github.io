# What is this website?
This is a [website](https://franciscoliu.github.io/covid-19-prediction.github.io/) that displays the result of the [paper](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.04.21249218v1.full).

# User Instructions
A user can either utilize the searching bar or the check-box to pick the target state (up to 3 states). Afterwards, the user is able to see the difference between groundtruth/predicted of each selected state. (Note that the corresponding check-box would also be checked automatically if a user searches a state via the searching bar).
